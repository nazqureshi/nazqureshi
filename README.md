- 👋 Hi, I’m @nazqureshi
- 👀 I’m interested in software development, game design, and looking to learn more about machine learning/AI. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, and will be starting a computer science degree in January 2024. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects once I learn more and become more proficient with Java, and once I begin to move on to learning other languages. 
- 📫 How to reach me --> Email: nqureshi7865@gmail.com
